<p>
  Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:
  </br></br>

  1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...
  </br></br>

  By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

<script type="text/javascript">
  var fibonacci = 1;
  var prev = 1;
  var current = fibonacci;
  var sum = 0;

  do {
    fibonacci = prev + current
    prev = current
    current = fibonacci

    if(fibonacci % 2 == 0) sum += fibonacci
  } while (fibonacci < 4000000)

  console.log(`Solution\n\n${ sum }`)
</script>
